# AutomaCon Day 3

## [KEYNOTE] Abstractions and Metaphors: Building Better Tools and Processes by Caring About Words
**[Nigel Kersten](https://twitter.com/nigelkersten), CIO & VP of Operations @ [Puppet](https://twitter.com/puppetize)**

*We use a lot of metaphors and abstractions in operations and our automation tooling such as "war room", "technical debt", and "orchestrate". Metaphors have largely been treated as a purely linguistic construction in the Western academic tradition, yet cognitive linguists such as George Lakoff argue that metaphors are in fact conceptual and shape our thoughts whether we’re aware of them or not. In this talk we’ll take a quick tour through some concepts of cognitive linguistic theory and how understanding the impact words have can lead to better tooling and processes.*

## Operations anti-patterns: how our bad habits harm systems reliability
**[Sam Kottler](https://twitter.com/samkottler), Engineering Manager @ [GitHub](https://twitter.com/github)**

*This talk with go through anti-patterns which harm the health of the systems we're tasked with operating. Some of the things we'll talk about have reached industrial meme status, yet when practically deployed actively harm the goals of those who focus on systems reliability. Others seem logical, but have hard-to-predict implications on the relationship between software and the systems on which that software runs. This brief overview of anti-patterns will go over why seemingly reasonable patterns can harm us and how to avoid them*

## Don’t Stop Believing: Our Infrastructure as Code Journey at Paperless Post
**[Bethany Erskine](https://twitter.com/skymob), Staff Systems Engineer @ [Paperless Post](https://twitter.com/paperlessdev)**

*Take a walk with me through Paperless Post's journey from a humble startup with no operations team and 12 artisanal servers to 300 servers, 40 developers and 7 operations team members. I'll describe the problems we've solved and lessons we've learned in going from zero to Infrastructure as Code: the patterns and tools we employ, how we're doing it now, and how we could be doing it better as we grow in staff, traffic and sales.*

## Infra as Code: The Organizational Bottleneck and the Shared Service Anti-Pattern
**[Evan Gilman](https://twitter.com/evan2645), Ops Engineer @ [PagerDuty](https://twitter.com/pagerduty)**

*As your company's Engineering team grows, and the rate of infrastructure evolution increases, it becomes increasingly apparent that it is not only your Ops team that needs to manipulate the infrastructure codebase - it's everyone! So tools are built, skills are taught, and before you know it, the infrastructure codebase is the most contentious in the whole organization. This talk chronicles PagerDuty's journey from Ops-driven evolution to distributed evolution, the pains involved and the hard lessons learned*
