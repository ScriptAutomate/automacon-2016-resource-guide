# AutomaCon Day 1 (Hack Day)

## Fear, Uncertainty, and Continuous Deployment
**Eric Sigler, Head of DevOps @ PagerDuty**

*This lightning talk will cover adopting Continuous Deployment (CD) on services that were previously NOT Continuously Deployed. It's "easy" to apply CD to greenfield services, but that's not terribly helpful to all of the existing code out there. This talk will include examples and techniques for introducing CD tooling to engineers, verifying behavior of automation concurrently to existing processes, and keeping stakeholders calm and business needs met throughout the drive to faster delivery and value.*

## Bots Not Cattle
**Josh Berkus , Project Atomic Community Lead @ Red Hat**

*It's time to replace an outdated metaphor. "Cattle Not Pets" is the slogan of much of the container ecosystem, but that concept breaks down when you start looking at increasingly complex and sophisticated services. I will introduce a new metaphor, "Bots Not Cattle" to discuss how we should be building the smart, self-managing services of the future. Examples will be drawn from the game Robo Rally, and code shown for an example PostgreSQL High Availability service*

## Being an introvert at a conference is not as hellish as you think it is.
**JJ Asghar , Sr Partner Engineer @ Chef**

*I'd like to give some advice on how to deal with conferences as an introvert. Over the last couple years I've grown and learned to engage with the tech community in ways that an introvert would find challenging. This talk will hopefully help the audience avoid some of the landmines that I have stepped on.*

*I want to help out my fellow introverts to realize that it's OK to be an introvert at big conferences. We can enjoy them too.*

## Rust's Community Automation
**E. Dunham , DevOps Engineer @ Mozilla**

*Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety. Behind the scenes, Rust is also a community that nurtures new contributors, consistently enforces its code of conduct, and maintains a high-quality codebase.*

*This talk will discuss the implementation details, as well as the social motivations and effects, of the customized infrastructure and workflow practices which allow the small core team to have such a significant impact, with special emphasis on the tooling to which contributors offload mundane tasks in order to reduce burnout.*

##A culture of safety: minimizing misery in regulated environments
**Elliot Murphy @ Kindly Ops**

*Discussions of security, compliance, and safety all too often start and end with technical controls. In this talk I'll share experiences helping multiple companies meet the demands of regulators and customers for safeguarding medical data without driving the engineers to frustration. No buzzwords or FUD, just real human experience of overcoming the challenges to applying infrastructure as code in traditionally conservative domains.*

## Kubernetes for Sysadmins
**Kelsey Hightower , Staff Developer Advocate, Google Cloud Platform @ Google**

*In this hands-on workshop you will learn how to build automation tools on top of the Kubernetes API. After attending this workshop you will know how to:*

* *Build a workload rebalancer to shift workloads across a Kubernetes cluster*
* *Build a custom scheduler*
* *Build integrations between Kubernetes and popular load balancers such as Nginx and HAProxy.*
* *Distribute application configs and secrets using HashiCorps vault.*

*This workshop is for advanced Kubernetes users looking to take their Kubernetes skills to the next level. Attendees should have experience managing applications in a Kubernetes cluster.*

Building atop Kubernetes: from fleet to Kubernetes
by Jason Hansen @ DEIS
Tuesday, September 27, 2016 at 12:10 PM

Deis has recently re-platformed our open source, Heroku-inspired PaaS from fleet to Kubernetes. As we've swapped orchestration and scheduling engines we've learned a number of lessons, decomposed a monolithic platform, and built a package manager. Join us and follow along as we install and configure Workflow, a complex, multi-service application. See how we are using Kubernetes abstractions to provide simple developer self-service. After this workshop you will have a solid understanding of Helm and Deis Workflow.

Augmented Reality with JFrog Artifactory : Metadata to automate pipelines from Dev to Ops
by Baruch Sadogursky , Developer Advocate @ JFrog
Tuesday, September 27, 2016 at 2:40 PM

DevOps is about eliminating silos to ensure better collaboration between Dev and Ops. Wouldn't it be magical to know exactly when how and what the developer built to make better decisions when, how and what should be packaged, distributed and deployed? In this talk we'll show how you can use JFrog Artifactory metadata to build a completely automated, bulletproof CI/CD pipelines, ensuring that Ops–related artifacts, like rpm packages are built to include only the right Dev-related artifacts.
