# AutomaCon 2.0: 2016 Resource Guide

From the [AutomaCon website](http://www.automacon.io/):

## AutomaCon: The Infrastructure as Code Conference

<center><i>If you were to conduct an informal survey of our industry peers and ask them to define Infrastructure as Code, it's quite possible that no two answers would be the same. Many would respond "Chef" or "Puppet" or another flavor of configuration management. Others might suggest that container-based solutions such as Docker are the answer. Still others might think of full-stack templating solutions such as Terraform. In reality, none of these tools alone can tell the whole story.</br></br>

Modern DevOps concerns have evolved to encompass more holistic approaches to infrastructure automation. AutomaCon will gather the leading minds and practitioners in the DevOps community together to exchange ideas, with the goal of updating and unifying the industry's definition of "Infrastructure as Code". We will draw on the experiences of those who have stories to share, learn about new tooling & workflows, and identify vendor-agnostic best practices.</br></br></i></center>

This conference was held over three days, and this guide has a dedicated section to each day:
* [Day 1 (Hack Day)](day1.md)
* [Day 2](day2.md)
* [Day 3](day3.md)

If you find this document useful, found some related links you would suggest I be placing here, or want to see what other bits I throw into the void of the internet, then definitely stop by and subscribe/follow/comment to my blog or twitter.
I felt that I couldnâ€™t throw this resource document out there without also including an important link listing for everything AutomaCon. These are my top links:

* [AutomaCon.io](http://www.automacon.io/)
* [Heavy Water YouTube Playlists](https://www.youtube.com/user/heavywaterops): AutomaCon 2015 and 2016 recordings!

This resource guide will be listing the following links for each speaker/presentation:

* Speaker and company twitter accounts
* Speaker and company tech blogs
* Blog article(s) by the speaker, or someone else, related directly to the presentation(s)
* Recordings of the presentations
* Misc. items I found important enough to link that were dropped in the AutomaCon slack, or referenced in presentations

**Check for Updates!** This ebook may be updated with new and corrected content. I make it available in two ways:

* The main, authoritative [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/ScriptAutomate/automacon-2016-resource-guide)
* The [GitBook page](https://www.gitbook.com/book/scriptautomate/automacon-2-0-resource-guide), where you can browse books online, or download as PDF, EPUB, or MOBI. Using the online reader, you can link to specific chapters.

The main GitHub repo is authoritative. GitBook will usually contain the latest version, including not-yet-finished bits.

## Who Put This Guide Together?

Someone attending who wanted an excuse to put together an ebook made entirely in Markdown, and who wants speakers/attendees to be able to contribute to it as an open-source project.
